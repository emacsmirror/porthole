* Transport Layer Test Package

In order to test HTTP server, requests should be made from *outside Emacs*. To
do this, Python scripts are used. To manage the Python-based tests, I leverage
the testing facilities of Nose.

** Running the Tests

An Elisp wrapper is provided to spin up a test server and run the Python
tests against it automatically.

To run the test suite, load the file "test-http-rpc-server.el" and call the
function `hrpc-run-external-tests'. This function can be called interactively.
It will spin up the test server and run the Python tests against it.

Note that these tests do not run in a virtualized Emacs like Cask tests do. They
will modify your JSON-RPC server settings. It is recommended that you reload
your user configuration after running them if you wish to use the JSON-RPC
server.
